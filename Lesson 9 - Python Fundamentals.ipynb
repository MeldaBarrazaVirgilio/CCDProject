        ">\"A very little key will open a very heavy door.\" -― Charles Dickens, _Hunted Down_\n",
        "\n",
        "After so many years of programming in C, I found myself using it for basically everything, until one day in 1994 I was asked by a very wise boss to try [AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK). AWK was a text processing language developed at Bell Labs in the 1970s by the same team that created C and Unix. It was designed to be a tiny domain-specific language for working with streaming text data. One would feed data to an AWK script one line at a time. AWK would then output text to an output file, also one line at a time. It could, of course, remember things from one line to the next, allowing it to accumulate information along the way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Soon I was using AWK for lots of text processing tasks. One notable application was to translate mainframe data into SQL code for loading into a relational database. Data would come in one line at a time and then go right into the database. I think I got at least one promotion from just this one parlor trick. A year or so later, in late 1995 or early 1996, I used the same trick to develop a dashboarding web app that was cobbled together with AWK and bash scripts. No Perl. No Python. No PHP. No Java. Just AWK and bash on a Unix command line. I am still amazed that it worked but we never had a crash or any other bug reported.   \n",
        "\n",
        "One of the reasons why I loved AWK so much was a feature called \"associative arrays\" where we could index a variable length array with text **keys** instead of integers. We could even mix keys with integer indexes if we liked. This meant that, for example, I could have an array of birthdays indexed by people's names. Or vice versa if that was what I wanted.  Or, I could create a histogram for words in a file with two lines of code. The potential uses seemed endless. Nothing could have been more convenient for a wannabe smart and lazy programmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Python equivalent of an associative array is a **dictionary**. It does many of the same things as a list but with keys instead of positions. Like associative arrays, there are an endless array of uses. If you have ever pulled data from a web API or added a Series to a DataFrame then you have used something like a dictionary. It's just how it's done."

        "> ABOUT THE SLASHDOT EFFECT     \n",
        "> I discovered Slashdot my first semester at Fairfield in 1997. I was trying to figure out how to explain geek culture to my undergrad business students. \"You mean you actually call yourselves geeks? ...\" Why yes we did, and there was even this new website called Slashdot that billed itself as \"News for Nerds\" that was catching on with programmers around the world. Even the name was total geek, a play on how web newbies would read URLs aloud. The full URL was `http://slashot.org`. Try saying that out loud (in English) including punctuation, a couple times. It's quite the tongue twister.  \n",
        ">\n",
        "> In keeping with its motto, it was a sort of curated blog with open discussion (without a log in required) that linked to the freshest nerd content from around the web. Within a few months of its founding, it had a continuous, 24x7 readership in the millions, all very geeky and loyal. This was at a time when getting a few thousand people to visit a major media site was a big deal.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Slashdot became famous with the non-geek crowd when the blog postings began linking to not-so-nerdy newspapers, magazines, political candidates, and other media providers that were not prepared for **2 million** geeks clicking the link at _exactly_ the same time. Servers would fry and then seize up for good, leaving people wondering what the heck just happened and asking about backups. Such was the [Slashdot Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect).  \n",
        ">\n",
        "> I picked up this tee at a Linux World show circa 2006. By then Slashdot had faded a bit, though was still popular in the right circles. The site is still around, though with a much, much smaller readership. It lost a lot of the original geek readership when magazine publisher Condé Nast bought it around the time I picked up the tee shirt.   \n",
